Technical debt is a term that describes the accumulated costs of incomplete or poorly designed code. It happens when the requirements or constraints of a project change, and the code must be modified or extended to meet the new needs. As a result, the code becomes difficult to maintain, modify, or extend, and the project becomes more complex and expensive.

Technical debt is a common problem in software development, especially in large and complex projects. It can affect the quality and readability of the code, and it can cause delays, errors, and churn of team members.
