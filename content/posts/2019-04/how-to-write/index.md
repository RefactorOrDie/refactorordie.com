Writing on this website should be fairly easy, because of the utilities provided by VSCode and hugo site generator.

## Open editor

```sh
code ./writing.code-workspace
```

## New Post

```sh
# Setup new-post script
chmod +x ./new-post.sh

# Create a new post
./new-post.sh hello-world
```

## Debugging

```sh
# Start server
./serve.sh
```

Neat, now that I've setup the _perfectest_ environment for writing, we have no more excuses.

Right?
