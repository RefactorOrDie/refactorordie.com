During my time attending clubs at Missouri State and starting Covalent, I ended up doing a lot of graphic design. I did not execute great graphic design while making banner ads and poster, but it was better than most posters you would see on campus. Then, while working on Covalent, I did a lot of experience design work and some branding and visual work for our mobile app, _Parrot_.

It has been quite some time since I have gotten opportunities to do more of that creative visual work, so I am challenging myself to do more creative workâ€“writing, illustration, and graphic design.

It is important to me to be aware and understanding of all the roles on a team in order to collaborate and produce better work as a whole.

Today started off with the following todo list:

 - [ ] Find inspiring portfolios
 - [ ] Find a design challenge

Starting off by looking for portfolios (notably [Mackey Saturday](https://mackeysaturday.com/), [HeCo](https://www.helloheco.com/), and [UENO](https://ueno.co)), I found that each one had some form of identity associated with their content. For every portfolio I enjoyed reviewing, an identifying symbol and style tied their pages together. Thus, we add another task item.

 - [ ] Begin designing an emblem for my site and work

Then, at a later date, I intend to work on the overall style. I like the typography I started developing yesterday, but as I add more media, I will need to start figuring out the best way to present images and movies to create a good experience.

### Designing an Emblem

Designing is an alternation between sketching and digital production, once I had a good shape to start with, I opened up Figma to see what it might look like.

I did not think that the original "L" which was fat and wavy fit very well in the content. So I ended up moving more towards the 'Macaroni' idea. Which I placed in the footer and at the front of the blog.

But if we look at this stab, it is overall appealing, but it conveys very little about what I intend to communicate about my professional career. It feels quiet, fun, and simple.

Great, but if we look at the logos which other designers and developers are using who have work I enjoy, they tend to lean towards more hard edges and solid block shapes which give their names power and a feeling of security. Take, for example, some of Mackey Saturday's branding work: His own logo, Oculus's, or even Instagram's.

Now, looking at these logos, we see strength and intention in every shape.

So, I experimented with more solid shapes based on the cursive 'L'.

These are going down a path that I enjoy a lot because they capture direction and security, but there is no central shape being made yet.

It is important to revisit these with fresh eyes often. I know there is some adage about literally stepping back from some work and looking at it from a distance as it is easy to become focused on detail work of a concept which is not going to work as well as another one.
