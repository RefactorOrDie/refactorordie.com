Today, I have just completed setting up this website (colelawrence.com) with styles and content that I find pleasant enough. But why now? Why start blogging now?

For some time now, I have been encouraged to write.

The first time I was persuaded to start writing was when I met the [Mostly Serious team](https://mostlyserious.io) and [their co-founder, Jarad Johnson](https://medium.com/@jdjohnson), advised me to start writing. I began writing [the following thoughtless Medium story](https://medium.com/@colelawr/stream-of-unconsciousness-apartment-coffee-f453083918a2) with his push, and I purchased the book [_Everybody Writes_ by Ann Handley](http://a.co/fwFlRrJ) to study.

This venture into becoming the next greatest writer was short lived. I was not fully committed to the idea, and a history of poor experiences writing junk in school dissuaded my momentum.

I have just returned from the Open FSharp 2017 conference in San Francisco, where I learned about the importance of writing from [Scott Wlaschin](https://twitter.com/ScottWlaschin)â€“a phenomenal speaker who administers [F# for fun and profit](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/). Scott's talks, ["Functional Programming Design Patterns"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/fppatterns/) and ["Understanding parser combinators"](https://fsharpforfunandprofit.com/parser/), have been inspiring for me.

Scott told me, "you must write if you want to become a better writer." (or something like that). I realized I will never be pleased with my first jots, but if I intend to jot, I might as well get the pain of starting out of the way, now.

Equipped with a fresh listen of Stephen King's _On Writing_, a few good books to read (_The Idea Factory_, _The Beginning of Infinity_, and _Creativity Inc._), and a good reason to write, I'll be comfortable online in no time!
