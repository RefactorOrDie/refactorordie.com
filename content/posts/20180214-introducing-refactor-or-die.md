For many years, I've been lurking the interwebs of Rich Hickey, Rob Pike, and Chris Granger.

Over this time, I have collected a seemingly countless amount of inspirational books, lectures, talks, and presentations, from language designers, innovators, and managers.

These resources, ranging from _Engaged Leadership_ by Swindall to an inspiring talk on the features of Elixir 1.3 that everyone missed out on by Jos√® Valim, but after watching them, they have been _collecting dust_ in my YouTube playlists, and on my bookshelf, despite me consistently referring back to them to share.

So, I'm launching a website, RefactorOrDie.com, where I can share these resources all in one place with linkage between them. 

Since May now, I have been obsessed with understanding how we encode and organize information. I've read _Make it Stick_ by Brown, Roediger III, and McDaniel, and I've been thinking of new ways to organize and record information.

What if there was a YouTube browser which annotated notes you're taking as you are taking them? You could use the closed captions features of YouTube videos to assist in aligning specific notes to places in the video, since we tend to remember verbatim key phrases in System 1 thinking (Kahneman, _Thinking Fast and Slow_).

With better tools for cataloging information, I think that we can put more complex thinking patterns in reach of conceptualization. A similar thing happens when a developer begins to rely solely on their editor to correct typos and syntax errors.

Some would say the art of programming without syntax highlighting is becoming a lost art, and people are losing their ability to really understand their languages by heart, but this is no more true than saying that we can't truly understand our budget relying on a calculator over our purist long division.
