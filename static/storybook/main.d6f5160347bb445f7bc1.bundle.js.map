Over the course\n      of many projects and some recent experience with Flutter / Dart, I'd like\n      to share some novel state management techniques that leverage the brevity\n      of combining Functional Components, useContext, and my own Behavior-State\n      library.\n      <br />\n      To get us started I wanted to do a quick refresher on each of these topics\n      and how we can put

So, in our example, when we click this increment button, we'll get an alert.\n      <br />\n      The primary advantage to defining components functionally is that it\n      starts to remove a lot of

change\n      <br/>\n      This has the benefit of very fine grained control over when and where we need to re-render our virtual dom are.\n      <br/>\n      We then can use the useContext hook to
